Subject: [fs] cifs: unicode alignment and buffer sizing problems
Message-id: 1242394708-23097-1-git-send-email-jlayton@redhat.com
O-Subject: [RHEL5.3.z PATCH] BZ#494279: cifs: fix unicode alignment and buffer sizing problems
Bugzilla: 494279
RH-Acked-by: Josef Bacik <josef@redhat.com>
CVE: CVE-2009-1439

This is a backport of the patch for BZ#494280 to RHEL 5.3.z.

At session setup and tree connect, CIFS will save off some strings that
it gets from the server during the session setup and tree connect.

There are several places in this code that size the buffers for these
strings too small. The server will send strings in UTF-16 format (all
chars are 2 bytes), and these can translate to being up to 4 bytes in
UTF-8. Part of the patch just ensures that we size the buffer
appropriately for this -- 4 times the number of wide chars, plus 2 bytes
for the NULL terminator.

The string area of these responses is also word-aligned. The current
scheme that CIFS uses to compensate for the buffer alignment assumes
that the buffer will always be preceded by a 1 byte pad, but that's not
always the case. This patch fixes this by changing this to properly
check for the alignment by making sure that we start on a word boundary.
It also fixes a workaround for buggy windows servers that don't properly
NULL terminate the last string in the packet, and cleans up some
unneeded NULL termination.

Finally, it adds some "cFYI" debug printks that that show these strings
when a debug switch is set. This may help detect problems in this area
in the future.

The patch is a rollup of 5 patches from upstream. Some of these are not
yet in Linus' tree but are in Steve French's tree and should make their
way to Linus in the near future.

This patch was tested by mounting and unmounting different servers with
the cFYI switch enabled, and making sure that the resulting strings
looked correct.
