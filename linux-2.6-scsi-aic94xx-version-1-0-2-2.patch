Message-id: 20071221010825.GC20629@mars.boston.redhat.com
O-Subject: Re: [RHEL5 PATCH] RHBZ# 253301: Update aic94xx to version 1.0.2-2 and include SATA support
Bugzilla: 253301

RHBZ#:
------
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=253301

Description:
------------
The aic94xx driver and libsas code now includes support for SATA disks, as
of 2.6.23-rc1.
The following git commit summaries represent the changes that went into
2.6.23-rc1 for SATA support and are in this back-port:

 Darrick J. Wong (13):
 [SCSI] Add SATA support to libsas
 [SCSI] aic94xx: SATA tag mask not set correctly
 [SCSI] libsas: support NCQ for SATA disks
 [SCSI] Migrate libsas ATA code into a separate file
 [SCSI] aic94xx: Don't call pci_map_sg for already-mapped scatterlists
 [SCSI] sas_ata: Satisfy libata qc function locking requirements
 [SCSI] sas_ata: sas_ata_qc_issue should return AC_ERR_*
 [SCSI] sas_ata: ata_post_internal should abort the sas_task
 [SCSI] sas_ata: Don't copy aic94xx's sactive to ata_port
 [SCSI] libsas: Accept SAM_GOOD for ATAPI devices in sas_ata_task_done
 [SCSI] libsas: Unknown STP devices should be reported to libata as unknown.
 [SCSI] sas_ata: Assign sas_task to scsi_cmnd to enable EH for ATA devices
 [SCSI] sas_ata: Assign sas_task to scsi_cmnd to enable EH for ATA devices
 [SCSI] sas_ata: Implement sas_task_abort for ATA devices James Bottomley (17):
 [SCSI] lpfc: Fix NPIV compile problem
 [SCSI] libsas: Add SATA support to STP piece for SATA on SAS expanders
 [SCSI] libsas: fix up sas_smp_phy_control()
 [SCSI] aic94xx: add SATAPI support
 [SCSI] libsas: better error handling in sas_ex_discover_end_dev()
 [SCSI] libsas: fixup NCQ for SATA disks
 [SCSI] libsas, aic94xx: fix dma mapping cockups with ATA
 [SCSI] libsas: fix lockdep issue with ATA
 [SCSI] libsas: fix scr_read/write users and update the libata documentation
 [SCSI] libsas: make ATA functions selectable by a config option

RHEL Version Found:
------------------
N/A.

kABI Status:
------------
No symbols were harmed.

Upstream Status:
----------------
In 2.6.24.

Test Status:
------------
Tested for regression on existing hardware and as well with SATA drivers
to make sure the new feature works. Ran a 24-hr storage stress test
consisting
of iozone, dd, bonnie++ and performed hotplug operations - removal of power,
inserting of various drivers, removal of drivers, etc while running the
tests.
The kernel worked as expected (marking the 'non-existing' drivers as
dead) and saw the insertion of hard-disks properly.

CONFIG option:
------------------

You also need to enable a new config option:
CONFIG_SCSI_SAS_ATA=y

Attached is a new re-diff of the aic94xx patches which compile on top of
Jeff's SATA update patches.

I am running a 24-hr stress test right now and it is 8 hours in without failure.
I can't provide a Brew ID as the SATA patches cause a kABI break :-(
