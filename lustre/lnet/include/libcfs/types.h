 * it's unclear what external dependencies are tied
 * to that file (It's not just some source file #including it)
 * there is some build/packaging infrastructure that includes it.
 * Hopefully that will be resolved shortly, that file will
 * be removed, its contents copied here and this comment can be deleted.
