This is cloop, a Kernel module to add support for filesystem-independent,
transparently decompressed, read-only block devices.

Original Author: Paul 'Rusty' Russel
Extensions & Bugfixes: Klaus Knopper (http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/)

INSTALLATION:
-------------

make KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/linux-kernel/sources
(as root) mkdir -p /lib/modules/misc && cp cloop.o /lib/modules/misc/ 
(as root) depmod -a
(as root) mknod /dev/cloop b 240 0
(as root) mknod /dev/cloop1 b 240 1
...

USAGE:
------

Creating a compressed image:
 create_compressed_fs image blocksize > image.cloop_compressed

blocksize must be a multiple of 512  bytes. Make sure you have enough
swap to hold the entire compressed image in virtual memory! Use "-"
as filename to read data from stdin, as in:

 mkisofs -r datadir | create_compressed_fs - 65536 > datadir.iso.compressed

Mounting a compressed image (see above for device creation):
 insmod cloop.o file=/path/to/compressed/image
 mount -o ro -t whatever /dev/cloop /mnt/compressed

Starting from cloop version 1.0, setting of cloop compressed files via
losetup /dev/cloop1 /path/to/file
is possible. cloop 1.0 uses 64bit pointers instead of 32bit, so cloop files
are no longer limited to <= 4GB (uncompressed size).

For more information, please refer to the sources. If you don't understand
what all this is about, please DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO INSTALL OR USE THIS
SOFTWARE.
