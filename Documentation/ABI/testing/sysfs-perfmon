Description:	provide the configuration interface for the perfmon2 subsystems.
	        The tree contains information about the detected hardware, current
		state of the subsystem as well as some configuration parameters.

		The tree consists of the following entries:

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/debug (read-write):

		Enable perfmon2 debugging output via klogd. Debug messages produced during
		PMU interrupt handling are not controlled by this entry. The traces a rate-limited
		to avoid flooding of the console. It is possible to change the throttling
	        via /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit. The value is interpreted as a bitmask.
		Each bit enables a particular type of debug messages. Refer to the file
		include/linux/perfmon_kern.h for more information

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/pmc_max_fast_arg (read-only):

		Number of perfmon2 syscall arguments copied directly onto the
   		stack (copy_from_user) for pfm_write_pmcs(). Copying to the stack avoids
		having to allocate a buffer. The unit is the number of pfarg_pmc_t
		structures.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/pmd_max_fast_arg (read-only):

		Number of perfmon2 syscall arguments copied directly onto the
   		stack (copy_from_user) for pfm_write_pmds()/pfm_read_pmds(). Copying
		to the stack avoids having to allocate a buffer. The unit is the number
		of pfarg_pmd_t structures.


	/sys/kernel/perfmon/reset_stats (write-only):

		Reset the statistics collected by perfmon2. Stats are available
		per-cpu via debugfs.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/smpl_buffer_mem_cur (read-only):

		Reports the amount of memory currently dedicated to sampling
   		buffers by the kernel. The unit is byte.

   	/sys/kernel/perfmon/smpl_buffer_mem_max (read-write):

		Maximum amount of kernel memory usable for sampling buffers. -1 means
		everything that is available. Unit is byte.

   	/sys/kernel/perfmon/smpl_buffer_mem_cur (read-only):

		Current utilization of kernel memory in bytes.

   	/sys/kernel/perfmon/sys_group (read-write):

		Users group allowed to create a system-wide perfmon2 context (session).
   		-1 means any group. This control will be kept until we find a package
		able to control capabilities via PAM.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/task_group (read-write):

		Users group allowed to create a per-thread context (session).
   		-1 means any group. This control will be kept until we find a
		package able to control capabilities via PAM.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/sys_sessions_count (read-only):

		Number of system-wide contexts currently attached to CPUs.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/task_sessions_count (read-only):

		Number of per-thread contexts currently attached to threads.

   	/sys/kernel/perfmon/version (read-only):

		Perfmon2 interface revision number.

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/arg_mem_max(read-write):

		Maximum size of vector arguments expressed in bytes. Can be modified

	/sys/kernel/perfmon/mode(read-write):

		Bitmask to enable/disable certain perfmon2 features.
		Currently defined:
		- bit 0: if set, then reserved bitfield are ignored on PMC writes
