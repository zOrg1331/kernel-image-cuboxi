 * Text: "The z/VM CP interface device driver cannot be loaded without z/VM\n"
 * Severity: Warning
 * Description:
 * With the z/VM CP interface you can issue z/VM CP commands from a Linux
 * terminal session. On Linux instances that run in environments other than
 * the z/VM hypervisor, the z/VM CP interface does not provide any useful
 * function and the corresponding vmcp device driver cannot be loaded.
 * User action:
 * Load the vmcp device driver only on Linux instances that run as guest
 * operating systems of the z/VM hypervisor. If the device driver has been
 * compiled into the kernel, ignore this message.
