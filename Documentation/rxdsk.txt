RapidDisk (rxdsk) RAM disk and RapidCache (rxcache) Linux modules

== Description ==

RapidDisk or rxdsk was designed to be used in high performing environments and has been designed with simplicity in mind. Utilizing a user land binary, the system administrator is capable of dynamically adding new RAM based block devices of varying sizes, removing existing ones to even listing all existing RAM block devices. The rxdsk module has been designed to allocate from the system's memory pages and is capable of addressing memory to support Gigabytes if not a Terabyte of available Random Access Memory.

RapidCache or rxcache is designed to leverage the high speed performing technologies of the RapidDisk RAM disk and utilizing the Device Mapper framework, map an rxdsk volume to act as a block device's Write/Read-through cache. This can significantly boost the performance of a local or remote disk device.


== Module Parameters ==

RapidDisk
---------
max_rxcnt: Total RAM Disk devices available for use. (Default = 128 = MAX) (int)

RapidCache
---------
None.


== Usage ==

RapidDisk
---------
It is advised to utilize the userland utility, rxadm, but this is essentially what is written to the /proc/rxctl proc file to manage rxdsk volumes: 

Attach a new rxdsk volume by typing:
    # echo "rxdsk attach 0 8192" > /proc/rxctl 

Detach an existing rxdsk volume by typing:
    # echo "rxdsk detach 0" > /proc/rxctl 

Resize an existing rxdsk volume by typing:
    # echo "rxdsk resize 0 65536" > /proc/rxctl 


RapidCache
---------
It is advised to utilize the userland utility, rxadm, but this is essentially what is sent to the dmsetup command:

Map an existing rxdsk volume to a block device by typing:
    # echo 0 4194303 rxcache /dev/sdb /dev/rxd0 0 8 196608|dmsetup create rxc0

Parameter 1: Start block of source volume (in sectors).
Parameter 2: End block of source volume (in sectors).
Parameter 4: Source volume.
Parameter 5: Cache volume.
Parameter 7: Caching block size.
Parameter 8: Cache size (in sectors).

Unmap an rxdsk volume:

    # dmsetup remove rxc0


== Design ==

The memory management of the rxdsk module was inspired by the brd Linux RAM disk module.

The functionality of the rxcache module was inspired by Flashcache-wt and dm-cache.
