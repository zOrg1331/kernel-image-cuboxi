Bugzilla: 572971

Upstream status: c/s 15523 and 15532 in xen-3.1-testing.hg

Brew build: http://brewweb.devel.redhat.com/brew/taskinfo?taskID=2369823

Due to a mismatch between the opcode decoding table and the implementation
of the operand decoder in platform.c, the ARPL instruction would cause
the guest to crash if executed on a MMIO area.  While this is difficult
to exploit from non-root, it is theoretically possible to do so.  This
patch changes the failure path to inject #UD instead of crashing the domain.
The guest kernel will transform the #UD into a SIGILL.

Side note: the emulator vulnerabilities found in KVM are not present in
RHEL5 Xen because it uses VM86 mode to execute real-mode code on VMX,
and small specialized decoders for MMIO operations.  The emulator in
arch/x86/x86_emulate.c is only used rarely (the shadow paging code uses
it) and only to execute kernel-mode code.
