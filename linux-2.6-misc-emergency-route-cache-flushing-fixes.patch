O-Subject: [kernel team] [RHEL5.5 PATCH][EMBARGOED] emergency route cache flushing fixes  (BZ545411)
Bugzilla: 545663

CVE: CVE-2009-4272

Hello all -

Konstantin Khorenko reported various issues regarding the emergency route
cache flush mechanism:

  1) deadlock while doing an emergency flush, chain is locked twice:

   rt_intern_hash(
     spin_lock_bh(rt_hash_lock_addr(hash));  <-- locked 1st time
     rt_emergency_hash_rebuild
       rt_secret_rebuild_oneshot
         rt_cache_flush
	   rt_run_flush()
	     for (i = rt_hash_mask; i >= 0; i--) {
	       spin_lock_bh(rt_hash_lock_addr(i)); <-- locked again, deadlock

     Upstream is not affected by this as it does not flush the cache
     immediately but instead invalidates it and lets a gc do the flush.

  2) Uninitialized **rp pointer during route lookup. This was fixed upstream
     in commit 73e42897e8e5619eacb787d2ce69be12f47cfc21 but was not back
     ported to RHEL yet.

  3) Although not reported, I also back ported commit
     b6280b47a7a42970d098a3059f4ebe7e55e90d8d to fix a leak and make routes
     useable while caching is off.
