This description is from Jes's original posting:


Implement do_no_pfn() for handling mapping of memory without a struct page
backing it.  This avoids creating fake page table entries for regions which
are not backed by real memory.

This feature is used by the MSPEC driver and other users, where it is
highly undesirable to have a struct page sitting behind the page (for
instance if the page is accessed in cached mode via the struct page in
parallel to the the driver accessing it uncached, which can result in data
corruption on some architectures, such as ia64).

This version uses specific NOPFN_{SIGBUS,OOM} return values, rather than
expect all negative pfn values would be an error.  It also bugs on cow
mappings as this would not work with the VM.
