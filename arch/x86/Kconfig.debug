config TRACE_IRQFLAGS_SUPPORT
	def_bool y

source "lib/Kconfig.debug"

config STRICT_DEVMEM
	bool "Filter access to /dev/mem"
	help
	  If this option is disabled, you allow userspace (root) access to all
	  of memory, including kernel and userspace memory. Accidental
	  access to this is obviously disastrous, but specific access can
	  be used by people debugging the kernel. Note that with PAT support
	  enabled, even in this case there are restrictions on /dev/mem
	  use due to the cache aliasing requirements.

	  If this option is switched on, the /dev/mem file only allows
	  userspace access to PCI space and the BIOS code and data regions.
	  This is sufficient for dosemu and X and all common users of
	  /dev/mem.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

config X86_VERBOSE_BOOTUP
	bool "Enable verbose x86 bootup info messages"
	default y
	depends on !XEN
	help
	  Enables the informational output from the decompression stage
	  (e.g. bzImage) of the boot. If you disable this you will still
	  see errors. Disable this if you want silent bootup.

config EARLY_PRINTK
	bool "Early printk" if EMBEDDED
	default y
	help
	  Write kernel log output directly into the VGA buffer or to a serial
	  port.

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation
	  it is not recommended because it looks ugly and doesn't cooperate
	  with klogd/syslogd or the X server. You should normally N here,
	  unless you want to debug such a crash.

config EARLY_PRINTK_DBGP
	bool "Early printk via EHCI debug port"
	default n
	depends on EARLY_PRINTK
	help
	  Write kernel log output directly into the EHCI debug port.

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation
	  it is not recommended because it looks ugly and doesn't cooperate
	  with klogd/syslogd or the X server. You should normally N here,
	  unless you want to debug such a crash. You need usb debug device.

config DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
	bool "Check for stack overflows"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  This option will cause messages to be printed if free stack space
	  drops below a certain limit.

config DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
	bool "Stack utilization instrumentation"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Enables the display of the minimum amount of free stack which each
	  task has ever had available in the sysrq-T and sysrq-P debug output.

	  This option will slow down process creation somewhat.

config DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
	bool "Debug page memory allocations"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Unmap pages from the kernel linear mapping after free_pages().
	  This results in a large slowdown, but helps to find certain types
	  of memory corruptions.

config DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS
	bool "Debug access to per_cpu maps"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	depends on X86_SMP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y to verify that the per_cpu map being accessed has
	  been setup.  Adds a fair amount of code to kernel memory
	  and decreases performance.

	  Say N if unsure.

config X86_PTDUMP
	bool "Export kernel pagetable layout to userspace via debugfs"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	select DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to show the kernel pagetable layout in a
	  debugfs file. This information is only useful for kernel developers
	  who are working in architecture specific areas of the kernel.
	  It is probably not a good idea to enable this feature in a production
	  kernel.
	  If in doubt, say "N"

config DEBUG_RODATA
	bool "Write protect kernel read-only data structures"
	default y
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Mark the kernel read-only data as write-protected in the pagetables,
	  in order to catch accidental (and incorrect) writes to such const
	  data. This is recommended so that we can catch kernel bugs sooner.
	  If in doubt, say "Y".

config DEBUG_RODATA_TEST
	bool "Testcase for the DEBUG_RODATA feature"
	depends on DEBUG_RODATA
	help
	  This option enables a testcase for the DEBUG_RODATA
	  feature as well as for the change_page_attr() infrastructure.
	  If in doubt, say "N"

config DEBUG_NX_TEST
	tristate "Testcase for the NX non-executable stack feature"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && m
	help
	  This option enables a testcase for the CPU NX capability
	  and the software setup of this feature.
	  If in doubt, say "N"

config 4KSTACKS
	bool "Use 4Kb for kernel stacks instead of 8Kb"
	depends on X86_32
	help
	  If you say Y here the kernel will use a 4Kb stacksize for the
	  kernel stack attached to each process/thread. This facilitates
	  running more threads on a system and also reduces the pressure
	  on the VM subsystem for higher order allocations. This option
	  will also use IRQ stacks to compensate for the reduced stackspace.

config DOUBLEFAULT
	default y
	bool "Enable doublefault exception handler" if EMBEDDED
	depends on X86_32 && !X86_NO_TSS
	help
	  This option allows trapping of rare doublefault exceptions that
	  would otherwise cause a system to silently reboot. Disabling this
	  option saves about 4k and might cause you much additional grey
	  hair.

config IOMMU_DEBUG
	bool "Enable IOMMU debugging"
	depends on GART_IOMMU && DEBUG_KERNEL
	depends on X86_64
	help
	  Force the IOMMU to on even when you have less than 4GB of
	  memory and add debugging code. On overflow always panic. And
	  allow to enable IOMMU leak tracing. Can be disabled at boot
	  time with iommu=noforce. This will also enable scatter gather
	  list merging.  Currently not recommended for production
	  code. When you use it make sure you have a big enough
	  IOMMU/AGP aperture.  Most of the options enabled by this can
	  be set more finegrained using the iommu= command line
	  options. See Documentation/x86_64/boot-options.txt for more
	  details.

config IOMMU_LEAK
	bool "IOMMU leak tracing"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	depends on IOMMU_DEBUG
	help
	  Add a simple leak tracer to the IOMMU code. This is useful when you
	  are debugging a buggy device driver that leaks IOMMU mappings.

config MMIOTRACE_HOOKS
	bool

config MMIOTRACE
	bool "Memory mapped IO tracing"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && PCI && !XEN
	select TRACING
	select MMIOTRACE_HOOKS
	help
	  Mmiotrace traces Memory Mapped I/O access and is meant for
	  debugging and reverse engineering. It is called from the ioremap
	  implementation and works via page faults. Tracing is disabled by
	  default and can be enabled at run-time.

	  See Documentation/tracers/mmiotrace.txt.
	  If you are not helping to develop drivers, say N.

config MMIOTRACE_TEST
	tristate "Test module for mmiotrace"
	depends on MMIOTRACE && m
	help
	  This is a dumb module for testing mmiotrace. It is very dangerous
	  as it will write garbage to IO memory starting at a given address.
	  However, it should be safe to use on e.g. unused portion of VRAM.

	  Say N, unless you absolutely know what you are doing.

config IO_DELAY_TYPE_0XED
	int
	default "1"

config IO_DELAY_TYPE_UDELAY
	int
	default "2"

config IO_DELAY_TYPE_NONE
	int
	default "3"

choice
	prompt "IO delay type"
	default IO_DELAY_0X80

config IO_DELAY_0X80
	bool "port 0x80 based port-IO delay [recommended]"
	help
	  This is the traditional Linux IO delay used for in/out_p.
	  It is the most tested hence safest selection here.

config IO_DELAY_0XED
	bool "port 0xed based port-IO delay"
	help
	  Use port 0xed as the IO delay. This frees up port 0x80 which is
	  often used as a hardware-debug port.

config IO_DELAY_UDELAY
	bool "udelay based port-IO delay"
	help
	  Use udelay(2) as the IO delay method. This provides the delay
	  while not having any side-effect on the IO port space.

config IO_DELAY_NONE
	bool "no port-IO delay"
	help
	  No port-IO delay. Will break on old boxes that require port-IO
	  delay for certain operations. Should work on most new machines.

config DEBUG_BOOT_PARAMS
	bool "Debug boot parameters"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	depends on !XEN
	help
	  This option will cause struct boot_params to be exported via debugfs.

config CPA_DEBUG
	bool "CPA self-test code"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Do change_page_attr() self-tests every 30 seconds.

config OPTIMIZE_INLINING
	bool "Allow gcc to uninline functions marked 'inline'"
	help
	  This option determines if the kernel forces gcc to inline the functions
	  developers have marked 'inline'. Doing so takes away freedom from gcc to
	  do what it thinks is best, which is desirable for the gcc 3.x series of
	  compilers. The gcc 4.x series have a rewritten inlining algorithm and
	  disabling this option will generate a smaller kernel there. Hopefully
	  this algorithm is so good that allowing gcc4 to make the decision can
	  become the default in the future, until then this option is there to
	  test gcc for this.

	  If unsure, say N.

config KDB
	bool "Built-in Kernel Debugger support"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && !XEN
	select KALLSYMS
	select KALLSYMS_ALL
	help
	  This option provides a built-in kernel debugger.  The built-in
	  kernel debugger contains commands which allow memory to be examined,
	  instructions to be disassembled and breakpoints to be set.  For details,
	  see Documentation/kdb/kdb.mm and the manual pages kdb_bt, kdb_ss, etc.
	  Kdb can also be used via the serial port.  Set up the system to
	  have a serial console (see Documentation/serial-console.txt).
	  The key sequence <escape>KDB on the serial port will cause the
	  kernel debugger to be entered with input from the serial port and
	  output to the serial console.  If unsure, say N.

config KDB_MODULES
	tristate "KDB modules"
	depends on KDB
	help
	  KDB can be extended by adding your own modules, in directory
	  kdb/modules.  This option selects the way that these modules should
	  be compiled, as free standing modules (select M) or built into the
	  kernel (select Y).  If unsure say M.

config KDB_OFF
	bool "KDB off by default"
	depends on KDB
	help
	  Normally kdb is activated by default, as long as CONFIG_KDB is set.
	  If you want to ship a kernel with kdb support but only have kdb
	  turned on when the user requests it then select this option.  When
	  compiled with CONFIG_KDB_OFF, kdb ignores all events unless you boot
	  with kdb=on or you echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/kdb.  This option also
	  works in reverse, if kdb is normally activated, you can boot with
	  kdb=off or echo "0" > /proc/sys/kernel/kdb to deactivate kdb. If
	  unsure, say N.

config KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC
	int "KDB continues after catastrophic errors"
	depends on KDB
	default "0"
	help
	  This integer controls the behaviour of kdb when the kernel gets a
	  catastrophic error, i.e. for a panic, oops, NMI or other watchdog
	  tripping.  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC interacts with
	  /proc/sys/kernel/kdb and CONFIG_LKCD_DUMP (if your kernel has the
	  LKCD patch).
	  When KDB is active (/proc/sys/kernel/kdb == 1) and a catastrophic
	  error occurs, nothing extra happens until you type 'go'.
	  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 0 (default).  The first time
	  you type 'go', kdb warns you.  The second time you type 'go', KDB
	  tries to continue - no guarantees that the kernel is still usable.
	  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 1.  KDB tries to continue - no
	  guarantees that the kernel is still usable.
	  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 2.  If your kernel has the LKCD
	  patch and LKCD is configured to take a dump then KDB forces a dump.
	  Whether or not a dump is taken, KDB forces a reboot.
	  When KDB is not active (/proc/sys/kernel/kdb == 0) and a catastrophic
	  error occurs, the following steps are automatic, no human
	  intervention is required.
	  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 0 (default) or 1.  KDB attempts
	  to continue - no guarantees that the kernel is still usable.
	  CONFIG_KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC == 2.  If your kernel has the LKCD
	  patch and LKCD is configured to take a dump then KDB automatically
	  forces a dump.  Whether or not a dump is taken, KDB forces a
	  reboot.
	  If you are not sure, say 0.  Read Documentation/kdb/dump.txt before
	  setting to 2.

config KDB_USB
	bool "Support for USB Keyboard in KDB (OHCI and/or EHCI only)"
	depends on KDB && (USB_OHCI_HCD || USB_EHCI_HCD)
	help
	  If you want to use kdb from USB keyboards then say Y here.  If you
	  say N then kdb can only be used from a PC (AT) keyboard or a serial
	  console.

config KDB_KDUMP
	bool "Support for Kdump in KDB"
	depends on KDB
	select KEXEC
	default N
	help
	  If you want to take Kdump kernel vmcore from KDB then say Y here.
	  Of imsire. say N.
