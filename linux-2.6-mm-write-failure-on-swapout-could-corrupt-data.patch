Subject: [RHEL 5][PATCH] write failure on swapout could corrupt data
Date: Mon, 07 Aug 2006 10:55:55
Bugzilla: 216194
Message-Id: <1154962555.16862.5.camel@taijtu>
Changelog: write failure on swapout could corrupt data

fold from patches in -mm; original request was for RHEL 4.5.
Resubmit against RHEL 5 because I don't think the patches will
reach mainline in the RHEL 5 time frame.

Currently we can silently drop data if the write to swap failed. It usually
doesn't result in data-corruption because on page-in the process will receive
SIGBUS (assuming write-failure implies read-failure).

This assumption might or might not be valid.

This patch will avoid the page being discarded after a failed write. But
will print a warning the sysadmin _should_ take to heart, if a lot of swap
space becomes un-writeable, OOM is not far off.

Also add a similar message to the read failure.

Tested by making the write fail 'randomly' once every 50 writes or so.
